# AxisPhilly App Template

This template helps make simple apps (like [Changes in Crime by Neighborhood](http://apps.axisphilly.org/crime-change/) and [A License to Blight](http://apps.axisphilly.org/license-to-blight/)) by baking out [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) templates into HTML, compiling [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to CSS, linting, concatenating, and minifying (but not obfuscating!) JS, and versioning assets.

We got a lot of inspiration and guidance from the [NPR Apps](http://blog.apps.npr.org/) [app-template](https://github.com/nprapps/app-template).

**Checkout the `fullscreen-map` branch for a version of this app template setup for fullscreen map apps.** 

### File and folder information

- `css` - compiled .scss files for development
- `css\lib` - vendor css files
- `data` - Raw data, i.e. CSVs
- `js` - development versions of JS files
- `js\lib` - vendor/library JS files, i.e. underscore.js, backbone.js, etc.
- `img` - images
- `img\lib` - images for vendor libraries, i.e. leaflet marker image
- `sass` - .scss files
- `scripts` -  miscellaneous scripts used for data processing, etc.
- `views` - EJS templates
- `www`, `www\css`, `www\js`, etc - The compiled app and associated assets
- `www\data` - Processed data (i.e. JSON) for the app.
- `build.js` - Script to generate static HTML files from `server.js` routes. Called by Grunt `shell:build` task.
- `Gruntfile.js` - Grunt file with tasks, i.e. lint, deploy, etc.
- `package.json` - Node project file. We use the `name` attribute for the production url (i.e. http://apps.axisphilly.org/package-name) and the `version` attribute to version production assets.
- `server.js` - Express server used for development

### Initialize Template
    git clone git@github.com:AxisPhilly/app-template.git
    cd path/to/repo
    rm -rf .git 
    git init
    git add * .gitignore
    git commit -m "Import app template"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:AxisPhilly/repo-name.git
    git push -u origin master

### Install Dependencies
For asset management, static view compiling, and building, we use Node.js and [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com).

On OS X, you can use Homebrew to install Node: `$ brew install node`

There is also an install package for OS X and other systems available on the Node [website](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Install the [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) command line tool globally, with the command line interface: `$ npm install -g grunt-cli`

Install project dependencies (in the project folder): `$ npm install`

### Development/Working locally

For local development, we use an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server to serve files, compile SASS and render views. 

To run the server: `$ node server.js`

Then go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) in your browser.

### Add a new page

Adding a new page to the app is as simple as adding a route to the Express server and assigning it a view.

- Add a new route to Express. At the very least, you have to pass the environment variable to the view, in order to reference development/production resources respectively. For example:

        app.get('/route-name', function(req, res){
          res.render('view-name', {
            env: app.settings.env
          });
        });

- Then, create a new view in the `view` folder. The view name is the first parameter of the `res.render` method. The view can just be an `html` file, or it can use EJS templating to be more dynamic. Just make sure you pass the EJS variables to the route; which is the second parameter of the `res.render` method.

### Building a project

`grunt build` compiles your project in production mode. It will lint, concatenate, and minify JS files, bake-out the EJS templates into HTML, and compile SASS to CSS.

    $ grunt build

Make sure any data needed for the app is placed in `www\data`. Ideally, any data processing scripts should save output here.

The grunt commands can also be run independently:

- Lint JS files: `$ grunt jshint`
- Concatenate and minify JS files: `$ grunt uglify`
- Compile SASS to CSS: `$ grunt sass`
- Bake-out template files: `$ grunt shell`

### Deployment

Deployment to S3 is handled by grunt. Before you deploy, do the following:

- The value of the `name` key in `package.json` will be used as the S3 folder name, so make sure it's URL compliant.
- **Do not add the AWS credentials to the Gruntfile**. Grunt expects environmental variables stored as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Our convention is to store them in a file called `.env`, which you can then `source` to load into your environment.
- Check all the of `src` and `dest` values in the s3 grunt task `upload` key to make sure they are valid. The defaults are `www/*`, `www/js/*`, `www/css/*`, and `www/data/*`. Basically, they should match the folder structure of `www`.

Once you checked all of the above, you can deploy the app by running:

    $ grunt deploy
